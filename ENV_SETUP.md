## 1. Database

### `MONGO_URI`
**Required.**

Your full MongoDB connection string. The app uses this to connect to the database on every request.

**How to get it:**
1. Go to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and log in.
2. Open your **Project** → click your **Cluster** → click **Connect**.
3. Choose **Drivers** → select **Node.js**.
4. Copy the connection string. It looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
5. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your Atlas database user credentials (not your Atlas login — the database user created under **Database Access**).
6. Add your database name before the `?`:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/magdee-cms?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

**If missing:** Every API call returns 500 — the app is non-functional.

---

### `DB_NAME`
**Optional.**

Overrides the database name. If not set, the name embedded in `MONGO_URI` (the part before `?`) is used automatically. You can leave this unset if your URI already has the database name.

```
DB_NAME=magdee-cms
```

---

## 2. Authentication

### `JWT_SECRET`
**Required.**

A secret string used to sign and verify login tokens. Anyone with this value can forge admin sessions — keep it private.

**How to get it:**
Run this in your terminal to generate a secure random value:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Copy the output and use it as the value. Example output:
```
a3f9c2e1b4d87654321fedcba9876543210abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
```

**If missing or weak:** All login sessions and protected dashboard routes fail.

---

## 3. CORS & Cache Revalidation

### `PRODUCTION_URL`
**Required.**

The public URL of the **frontend** (Magdee website). Two things depend on this:
1. **CORS** — only this origin is allowed to call the public APIs (blog, services, etc.)
2. **Cache clearing** — after publishing content, the CMS calls `{PRODUCTION_URL}/api/revalidate` to clear the Next.js cache.

```
PRODUCTION_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

**How to get it:** This is the URL Vercel (or whatever host) gives the frontend after deployment. No trailing slash.

**If missing:** The frontend domain is blocked by CORS — all public pages stop fetching data from the CMS.

---

### `REVALIDATE_SECRET`
**Required.**

A shared secret between the CMS backend and the frontend. After a post/page is published, the CMS sends this value in a request header to the frontend to authorize a cache clear.

**How to get it:** Generate another random string the same way as `JWT_SECRET`:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

> **Important:** Set the exact same value in **both** the CMS backend env and the frontend env. If they don't match, published content won't appear on the site until the 1-hour cache expires.

**If missing:** Content updates are delayed up to 1 hour. Nothing crashes.

---

## 4. Email — Auth (OTP / Password Reset)

This email is sent to CMS users when they use the **Forgot Password** feature. It delivers a 6-digit OTP code.

The CMS uses **Nodemailer** with any standard SMTP server. The setup below uses **Gmail** which is the easiest option.

### Getting Gmail App Password (Recommended)

> You cannot use your regular Gmail password here. Google requires an **App Password** for third-party apps.

1. Go to your Google Account → [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com).
2. Click **Security** in the left sidebar.
3. Under "How you sign in to Google", make sure **2-Step Verification is ON**. (App Passwords require 2FA to be enabled.)
4. Go back to Security → scroll down → click **App passwords** (or search "App passwords" in the search bar).
5. Under "App name" type anything, e.g. `MagDee CMS`.
6. Click **Create**.
7. Google shows a 16-character password like `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`. **Copy it immediately** — it won't be shown again. Remove the spaces when pasting.

---

### `SMTP_HOST`
**Required.** The SMTP server address.
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
```
For other providers: Zoho → `smtp.zoho.com`, Outlook → `smtp.office365.com`, custom → ask your hosting provider.

---

### `SMTP_PORT`
**Required.**
```
SMTP_PORT=587
```
Use `587` for TLS (recommended). Use `465` only if your provider requires SSL and you set `SMTP_SECURE=true`.

---

### `SMTP_USER`
**Required.** The full Gmail address you generated the App Password for.
```
SMTP_USER=youraddress@gmail.com
```

---

### `SMTP_PASSWORD`
**Required.** The 16-character App Password from Step 7 above (no spaces).
```
SMTP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

---

### `SMTP_FROM`
**Required.** The display name and address shown as the sender in the email client.
```
SMTP_FROM="MagDee CMS <youraddress@gmail.com>"
```

---

### `SMTP_SECURE`
**Optional.** Set to `true` only if using port 465. For port 587 leave it unset or `false`.
```
SMTP_SECURE=false
```

**If any `SMTP_*` variable is missing:** The forgot-password flow fails with a 500 error. Regular login still works — only password reset is affected.

---

## 5. Email — Notification (Registration Alerts)

Every time a visitor submits their email on the frontend (early access form, contact page, blog, about page), the CMS sends an alert email to the admin inbox.

### How the fallback works

The notification system checks for `NOTIFY_SMTP_*` variables first. If they are not set, it automatically falls back to the `SMTP_*` variables above.

**In most cases you do not need to set any `NOTIFY_SMTP_*` variable.** Just set `SMTP_*` once (already done above) and add `ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`. The same Gmail account handles both OTP and notification emails.

Only set `NOTIFY_SMTP_*` if you want notification emails to come from a **completely different email address** than OTP emails.

---

### `ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`
**Required if you want alert emails.**

This is the on/off switch for the entire notification system. The `To:` address that receives the registration alert.

```
ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL=team@yourdomain.com
```

**If missing:** No alert emails are sent at all. Registration data is still saved to the database — nothing is lost. You just won't get real-time inbox notifications.

---

### `NOTIFY_CC_EMAIL`
**Optional.** A second address added as CC on every alert. If not set, defaults to `ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`.

```
NOTIFY_CC_EMAIL=founder@yourdomain.com
```

---

### `NOTIFY_SMTP_*` (only if using a separate email account)

If you want notifications from a different address (e.g. `alerts@yourdomain.com` instead of your Gmail):

```
NOTIFY_SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
NOTIFY_SMTP_PORT=587
NOTIFY_SMTP_SECURE=false
NOTIFY_SMTP_USER=alerts@yourdomain.com
NOTIFY_SMTP_PASSWORD=that-accounts-password
NOTIFY_SMTP_FROM="MagDee Alerts <alerts@yourdomain.com>"
```

Follow the same App Password steps above for whichever provider you use. If you skip these, the SMTP fallback kicks in and notifications go out from the same account as OTP emails.

---

## 6. Media Storage (Hostinger FTP)

Images uploaded through the CMS Media Library are stored on Hostinger via FTP. The CMS connects via FTP on upload, saves the file to a public directory, and returns the public URL that gets stored in the database.

### Getting Hostinger FTP Credentials

1. Log in to [hpanel.hostinger.com](https://hpanel.hostinger.com).
2. Select your hosting plan / website.
3. In the left sidebar go to **Files** → **FTP Accounts**.
4. You will see your default FTP account listed (or create a new one).
5. The details shown are:
   - **FTP Host** / Server: something like `navajowhite-octopus-630288.hostingersite.com` — this is your `HOSTINGER_FTP_HOST`
   - **FTP Username**: something like `u698468992.navajowhite-octopus-630288.hostingersite.com` — this is your `HOSTINGER_FTP_USER`
   - **Port**: `21` (default, always)
   - **Password**: the password you set when creating the FTP account. If you forgot it, click **Change Password** to set a new one — this is your `HOSTINGER_FTP_PASS`

6. For `HOSTINGER_MEDIA_URL` — this is the **public HTTP URL** that maps to the folder where files are uploaded. If your Hostinger site domain is `yourdomain.com` and files are stored in `public_html/media`, the URL is `https://yourdomain.com/media`. If you are using a temporary Hostinger subdomain (`.hostingersite.com`), use that instead.

---

### `HOSTINGER_FTP_HOST`
**Required.** The FTP server hostname from hPanel.
```
HOSTINGER_FTP_HOST=navajowhite-octopus-630288.hostingersite.com
```

---

### `HOSTINGER_FTP_USER`
**Required.** The FTP username from hPanel.
```
HOSTINGER_FTP_USER=u698468992.navajowhite-octopus-630288.hostingersite.com
```

---

### `HOSTINGER_FTP_PASS`
**Required.** The FTP account password you set in hPanel.
```
HOSTINGER_FTP_PASS=your-ftp-password
```

---

### `HOSTINGER_FTP_PORT`
**Optional.** Always `21` for Hostinger. Only set this if your provider uses a non-standard port.
```
HOSTINGER_FTP_PORT=21
```

---

### `HOSTINGER_MEDIA_PATH`
**Optional.** The remote folder path on the FTP server where uploads are saved. Defaults to `/public_html/media` if not set. The folder is created automatically on first upload if it does not exist.
```
HOSTINGER_MEDIA_PATH=/public_html/media
```

---

### `HOSTINGER_MEDIA_URL`
**Required.** The public HTTPS URL that serves files from the folder above. This is what gets stored in the database and embedded in pages.
```
HOSTINGER_MEDIA_URL=https://navajowhite-octopus-630288.hostingersite.com/media
```

> Make sure there is **no trailing slash** at the end of this URL.

**If any Hostinger variable is missing:** The media upload API fails. The upload button in the CMS Media Library returns an error. Images already saved in the database are not affected — their URLs still work.

## Email Setup — Decision Tree

```
Do you want CMS users to be able to reset their password?
  YES → Set all SMTP_* variables (Gmail App Password recommended)
  NO  → Leave SMTP_* unset (login still works, reset flow will error)

Do you want an email alert when a visitor submits the early access form?
  YES → Set ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL to your inbox
        (reuses the same Gmail account from SMTP_* above)
  NO  → Leave ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL unset (registrations still save to DB)

Do you want notification alerts sent from a DIFFERENT address than OTP emails?
  YES → Also set all NOTIFY_SMTP_* variables with that account's credentials
  NO  → Skip NOTIFY_SMTP_* entirely
```
